# PERSONAL CREDIT SCORING PROJECT

## Overview

In this project, I am working on building a credit scoring model to help borrowers make informed financial decisions. The project involves utilizing historical data from 250,000 borrowers to predict the probability of experiencing financial distress in the next two years.

## Description

Banks play a pivotal role in shaping economies by determining lending terms and making critical investment decisions. Access to credit is essential for individuals and companies to thrive in market economies. Credit scoring algorithms, which assess the likelihood of default, guide banks in granting loans. This project aims to enhance credit scoring accuracy by predicting the probability of financial distress.

## Evaluation Metric

To evaluate my model's performance, I will be using two metrics:
- AUC Score
- Accuracy Score

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I will be working with provided train and test datasets, and the following steps will be undertaken:

1. **Data Cleaning:** If necessary, I will clean the data to ensure its quality and reliability.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I will conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into the data.

3. **Data Visualization:** I will create meaningful visualizations, emphasizing detailed inferences. These visualizations will use a variety of plot types.

4. **Correlation Matrix:** I will plot the correlation matrix and identify the features most correlated with the response variable.

5. **Data Splitting:** I will split the data into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.

6. **Data Preprocessing:** This step involves handling duplicates, missing values, scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical features.

7. **Model Training:** I will build machine learning models using a linear-based model and a tree model.

8. **Model Evaluation:** I will train the models on the training set and assess their performance on the testing set.

9. **Feature Importance Plot:** I will visualize the feature importance of the models.

10. **AUC and Accuracy Scores:** I will calculate and compare the AUC and Accuracy scores of the trained models.

11. **Algorithm Comparison:** I will determine which algorithm performed better and provide reasoning for my choice.

12. **Inferences on Model Performance:** Based on the above analysis, I will comment on the model's ability to generalize on unseen data, addressing overfitting, underfitting, or generalization.

13. **Further Improvements:** I will share any interesting ideas or enhancements I would consider if I were to extend or improve the project further.
